This file's sole purpose is to be a dummy for the first commit and prove that my git skills are not limited just to my local machine.
P.S. Created in Vim, the best text editor (not and IDE) in the Universe
P.S.S. I am not using Arch btw  (Pop_OS! rules supreme but I will try Arch after getting junior grade job)
P.S.S.S. If you are reading this file for some reason, congrats! I am proud that someone in the world has indeed looked at my github.
P.S.S.S.S. I hope I do get a job even as trainee this month
